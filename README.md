Stephanis_CouponDispensers
==========================

A Magento Coupon Code Dispenser widget for users with a specific email tld.

If you want to issue single-use coupon codes to users from another company -- b2b marketing or the like -- this will integrate with CampaignMonitor as a data store.  All submitted emails will be added to a specified list, along with the date the last code was issued to them, and the code they were most recently given.  You can specify in months (default 6) the interval at which the user can request a new coupon code.

Requirements
============

I believe it requires Magento CE 1.7+ -- but may be modifiable to an older version.  I'll verify version requirements and confirm soon.
